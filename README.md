Developed a R Shiny Dashboard on COVID-19. 
Key features:
1. Live Update of India and comparison of various statistics at one shot. The page updates automatically every 5 minutes.
2. Country-wise comparisons of key statistics in one place. This is a daily data (not live) extracted from Johns Hopkins University database.
3. A pivot table based on India data is included as well. It provides user the flexibility to do further deep-dive analyses.
4. A crude forecast based on extrapolation of growth rates is included as well. Will try to include the SIR model forecasts once we have long and consistent data for most of the countries.
5. User friendly visualisations with thought through usage of colour scales, zoom-in, zoom-out features and date range filtering.
6. Latest news articles related to COVID-19.

Happy Analysing.
